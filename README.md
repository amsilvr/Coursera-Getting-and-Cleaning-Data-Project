# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This is the project for the Coursera course Getting and cleaning data


The pertinent files included are the run_analysis.R script, and the tidy_Data.txt text file.
The run_analysis.R script basically does all of the work.

To run this project, follow the steps below:

•	Open the run_analysis.R script and change the parameter in the first setwd() command to set the working directory initially.

•	The input data set for the script is downloaded and unzipped in the current working directory by the script itself if not done already. Further path settings are also done within the script itself.

•	You can open the script in R Studio and run the code or alternatively use source(run_analysis.R) command. This runs the script.

•	The script after successful execution produces an output file tidy_Data.txt which contains the output tidy data set.

•	This data set can be again opened in R using the commented code (read.table) at the end of the script.
